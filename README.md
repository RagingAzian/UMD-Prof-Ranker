## How It's Made: 

**Tech Used**: Python, Python Discord Library, Planet Terp API

The bot uses Planet Terp API to get data about courses and professors. The information includes professor ratings, course evaluations, and average GPA statistics. By analyzing this data, the bot can rank based on either ratings or GPA. There is also a feature where it ranks courses in a specific department such as Computer Science by GPA,
so users know what classes are more difficult. Users can also look up a specific professor to get their average rating and GPA. Users can get even more specific information by providing a course the professor has taught to get data for that specific course.

## Lessons Learned: 

Working on this project provided valuable experience in parsing JSON files and sorting data efficiently. By interacting with the API and handling the returned data, I developed a deeper understanding of structuring and managing JSON data. Additionally, sorting this data based on various criteria enhanced my skills in data organization and manipulation.
